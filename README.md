Abstract
--------

Text in an image provides vital information for interpreting its contents, and text in a scene can aid a variety of tasks from navigation to obstacle avoidance and odometry. Despite its value, however, detecting general text in images remains a challenging research problem. Motivated by the need to consider the widely varying forms of natural text, we propose a bottom-up approach to the problem which reflects the 'characterness' of an image region. In this sense our approach mirrors the move from saliency detection methods to measures of 'objectness' . In order to measure the characterness we develop three novel cues that are tailored for character detection, and a Bayesian method for their integration. Because text is made up of sets of characters, we the design a Markov random field (MRF) model so as to exploit the inherent dependencies between characters. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our characterness cues as well as the advantage of Bayesian multi-cue integration. The proposed text detector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a few benchmark scene text detection datasets. We also show that our measurement of 'characterness' is superior than state-of-the-art saliency detection models when applied to the same task.

Installation
-------------

Before you use this software, please download the [vlfeat toolbox](http://www.vlfeat.org/) and add it to the current Matlab search path. 

Getting started
---------------

Please run the demo.m file to see how the algorithm works. 

Note that in the package, we load pretained distributions of the three cues on characters and non-characters (See data/CueNegativeDistribution_229.mat and data/CuePositiveDistribution_229.mat).The distributions are learned from the ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition (Challenge 2) training set.
